This involved selecting a Node module for exporting the data from the Quill editor to the Python script and selecting the Python library to handle saving the data to a Word document. Solution: Tested several different modules and Python packages, logging their features and shortcomings, eventually settling on ones that best fit the needs of the project. Non-Intrusive User Reminders Challenge: Satisfying the requirement of reminding the user to log their work while avoiding disrupting them mid-thought Solution: Implemented a fade-in animation so the reminder window gently appears without drawing too much attention. Placed the window in the bottom right corner to keep it out of the way. Ensured it would always be the top window so it was always in view , acting as a subtle reminder for the user to take a note when they finish their current task. Conditional Application Runtime Challenge: Ensuring the application runs only during periods when the user is performing relevant work they want to log. Solution: Implemented a settings feature that allows the user to define their working hours, with advanced settings for greater flexibility in when the application runs day to day. Image Resizing and Indented Lists formatting issues Challenge: Images resized in the editor did not retain their dimensions when exported to the Word document and nested bullet points did not retain their nested format when exported. Solution: Modified the Python library responsible for exporting HTML to Word to handle resized images correctly and so it correctly interpreted and applied indentations for nested lists, ensuring they appear as intended in the Word document. Error Handling and Invalid Inputs Challenge: Preventing invalid user inputs within the settings and handling errors effectively. Solution: Implemented alerts to handle any invalid cases, providing immediate feedback to the user and preventing the application from proceeding with invalid settings.
